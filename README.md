# Pre-Qualification Project for METU Statistics and Data Science Club Datathon 2023

Welcome to the pre-qualification project repository for the METU Statistics and Data Science Club Datathon 2023. This project aims to analyze user behavior and product sales data from an online retailer during the first six months of a given period and build predictive models that can forecast user purchasing behavior's *churn variable*.

The *churn variable* is a crucial factor in customer retention and business analytics as it represents the percentage of customers who have stopped using a company's product or service over a given period. Understanding churn can help businesses identify areas for improvement, develop targeted retention strategies, and ultimately increase customer loyalty and revenue.
